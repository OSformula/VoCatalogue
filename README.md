# About this software
So, what is this thing? It's a small app that allows you to save your TTS software activation codes and its installer locations. This is incredibly useful in case you have lots of products or you want to change computers and have a proper control of what you need or what you're missing.

# FAQ
* Why isn't (insert character here) in this list?
Surely it isn't here because it's either not released or it's too recent. Wait a week or so and it'll be added.

* Why isn't (insert engine here) in this list?
As for now, I just added the commercial TTS that require some sort of activation code or related, if more engines get released in the future with few voices, it'll be added in "Others", if there's enough banks available, I'll make it have its own group.
  
* Why (insert character here) is such an ugly illustration? Why don't you use the one made by <insert person here> or an old version of it?
The illustrations/photos shown will always be the canonical ones shown in the latest physical release of the TTS voice. In case there's no physical, it will always be the latest digital release of that specific version.
  
* What about UTAU?
There's plans of adding UTAU and other "free SDK" TTS down the line, but not now.
