# Special thanks and disclaimer
Special thanks to LuxiayK for doing the images from V1 to V3 and his improvements towards this app and to Ran, Kurohaine, Henia and RayTS for their constant help towards my general life.

***Disclaimer:***
* VoCatalogue_data.ini has all your information. Keep that file safe and do not lose it or rewrite it with the template file included.
* I do not take any liability for any of the forks done from this software nor if you lose your codes because you left them in here and threw the original copy. This is just a local-based library software to be used as a backup.

# About this software
So, what is this thing? It's a small app that allows you to save your TTS software activation codes and its installer locations. This is incredibly useful in case you have lots of products or you want to change computers and have a proper control of what you need or what you're missing.

After a while having this code in here and due to several projects starting to take more of the "free time" cake I have in my brain, I have decided to release it as it is right now. Everyone's free to fork and upgrade this mess of a software that I tried to do, just remember to at least not delete the credits. Even if it was a mess, it took me a good while to do.

Last thing, this software handles everything locally, nothing is sent online so please, be sure to save your activation codes safely aside from this app (aka do not throw all codes into the bin once you added them here).
# How to install it
Just decompress the file into your system. If you see any error about redistributables or it doesn't fully load, remember to install those from Windows themselves.

# How to use it
Add the characters using the "Add person" button, then add your links to your files and the activation code there. You can also check the settings in case you wanna change some images for alternative ones; or see what I had planned to do for other engines.

# FAQ
* Why isn't (insert character/engine here) in this list?

Surely it isn't here because it's either not released or it's too recent. The latest one added is Rikka from SynthV. As for engines, I only added most of the commercial TTS that require some sort of activation code or related.
  
* Why (insert character here) is such an ugly illustration? Why don't you use the one made by <insert person here> or an old version of it?
  
The illustrations/photos shown will always be the canonical ones shown in the latest physical release of the TTS voice. In case there's no physical, it will always be the latest digital release of that specific version.
  
* What about UTAU? Why there's no images from some characters?
  
As I said, I have to prioritize getting cash due to the general *waves hands* happenings on the world. There were plans to add those but as for now, I need to focus on doing 2D and 3D commissions, as those give me money, and this project doesn't. I don't feel like doing a Patreon-like thingy to then make this YSimulator 2.0 with people paying for few-to-none updates.
